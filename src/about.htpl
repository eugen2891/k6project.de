!About me
Born in 1982, I became enchanted with all things computer science at the age of 15, especially games and technology powering them (well, who wasn't, right?). Paving my way through the rough IT-landscape of Ukraine, I had to go through programming of web-apps, ERP systems and desktop applications, before I was finally able to secure myself a place in game industry (which happened already in Germany, where I live since 2012). I have started my work at InnoGames, being part of a small team to re-create company's web-based strategy Forge Of Empires on mobile platforms. Three years later, having way more interest for underlying technology then games themselves, I have joined the core technology team at DeepSilver FISHLABS, just in time to support the team during final stages of Galaxy On Fire 3: Manticore.
Aside from that, I am a happily married man and a father of two wonderful children. I enjoy travelling and sightseeing, which I normaly do together my my whole family. I like listening to my wife and kids playing the piano (something that I am incapable of). We reside in a beautiful city of LÃ¼beck, about 70km to the northeast of Hamburg.
